Hey! Are you loving ZXing for JS? 

We do the best we can to support this lib, but we can't dedicate full time to it due to financial reasons.
We'd love to be able to be more present on the project, not only on our spare time. If you'd like to help
please consider supporting us via any of the sponsor links or simply opencollective.com/zxing-js .

Or just say thanks, that's much appreciated as well! And will fill our hearts. 🖤

Thank you and good luck!
-->
